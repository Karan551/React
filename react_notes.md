# React Notes :-

## How can we create a basic setup for react with VITE :-

- Create a folder where you want to store your code and open terminal in that folder and type the following command:-
  ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
  ```
- After typing the following command you prompt enter the details after creating successfully project you will have to open a terminal in that folder and type the following  command :-
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
-----
## What we can render in react :-
- We can render `string` ,`array` and `number` also but we cannot render `object` , `boolean` expression.

- For example :-
- **path ðŸ‘‰ src/App.jsx**
  ```JSX
  function App() {

  // declare string 
    const name = "Dave";

    // declare number 
    const myNumber = 45;

    // declare an array
    const myArr = ["Hello", 1, 2];

    // declare an object.
    const myObj = {
      name: "Mahesh",
      active: true,

    };
    // declare a variable
    const active =true

    return (
      <>
        <p>This is string- {name}</p>
      {/* output -> Dave  */ }
        <p>This is number- {myNumber}</p>
        {/* output -> 45  */ }


        <p>This is an array - {myArr}</p>
        {/* output -> Hello12  */ }

        <p>This is an object - {myObj}</p> 
        {/* Gives error */ }

        <p>This is boolean expression {true===false}</p>
        {/* output -> empty (no output)  */ }
      </>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

- Even though we can call a **function** also and **we can render that function returns value.**
  
- For example :-
- **path ðŸ‘‰ src/App.jsx**
  ```JSX
  function App() {

    const nameArr = ["Master", "Ganesh", "Mahesh", "Amitesh", "Alokesh"];

    // declare a function
    const handleName = () => {
      const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * nameArr.length);
      return nameArr[randomNum];
    };
    console.log("This is name:", handleName());
    return (
      <>
        {/* call a function inside curly braces */}
        <h1>Hello {handleName()}</h1>
        
      </>
    );
  }

  ```

## How can we apply css in React(JSX) :-

- We can apply **inline** `css` and **external** and **internal** `css` that we want.

  ### How can we apply Inline CSS :-

  - We can apply `css` with the following method :-
  <h4 align="center">1st Method ðŸ‘‡</h4>

    ```JSX
    import React from 'react';

    const Header = () => {
      return (
          <header style={ { backgroundColor: "blueviolet", fontSize: "2rem", textAlign: "center" } }>
              Groceries List
          </header>
      );
    };

    export default Header;

    ```
    <h4 align="center">2nd Method ðŸ‘‡</h4>

    ```JSX
    import React from 'react';

    const Header = () => {

      //Here we will write css 
      const headerStyle={ backgroundColor: "blueviolet", fontSize: "2rem", textAlign: "center" }

      return (
          <header style={headerStyle}>
              Groceries List
          </header>
      );
    };

    export default Header;

    ```
   ## How can we apply external `css` in JSX :- 
  
  - We will have to **write external css file** like `index.css` or that we want and then we will have to **import this css file in our main component or child component where we want to include (main componened (recomended)).**
  
  - **First Step :-**
  - **path** ðŸ‘‰ **src/index.css**
    ```css
    body{
      font-size:3rem;
      display:grid;
      place-content: center;
      min-height:100vh;
    }
    ``` 
  - **Second Step :-**
    
    ```JSX
    // Here import css file 
    import './index.css' 

    function App() {

      return (
        <main>

        <h2> Hello World</h2>
        
        </main>
      );
    }

    export default App;

    ``` 
    - We can also `import` `main.jsx` file.

## What is HTTP Protocol ?
- HTTP is a protocol, or a definite set of rules, for accessing resources on the web. Resources could mean anything from HTML files to data from a database, photos, text, and so on.

- These resources are made available to us via an API and we make requests to these APIs via the HTTP protocol. API stands for application programming interface. It is the mechanism that allows developers to request resources.

### Some Important `Request` Methods Are :-

1. **`GET` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **By default Http request is `GET` if we are not define explicitly.This method is used only for read data.**

2. **`POST` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **`POST` method is used to add new data. Every time when we want to use this method we will have to define explicitly.**
   
3. **`PUT` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **`PUT` method is used to modify a resource. This method updates the entire resource with data that is passed in the body payload. If there is no resource that matches the request, it will create a new resource.**
   
4. **`PATCH` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **`PATCH` method applies partial modification to a resource. We use `PATCH` request to modify a part of a resource. With `PATCH`, we will have to pass data that we want to update.**
   
5. **`DELETE` :-** ðŸ‘‰  **`DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.**


  #### What is difference between `PUT` request and `POST` request :-
- **`PUT` requests are idempotent(means same result if we do same work many times), meaning that executing the same `PUT` request will always produce the same result.**

**On the other hand, a `POST` will produce different outcomes. If you execute a POST request multiple times, you'll create a new resource multiple times despite them having the same data being passed in.**

**Using a restaurant analogy, `POST`ing multiple times would create multiple separate orders, whereas multiple `PUT` requests will update the same existing order.**

#### What is difference between `PUT` request and `PATCH` request :-
- **The key differences are that `PUT` will create a *new resource if it cannot find* the specified resource. And with `PUT` you need to pass in data to update the entire resource, even if you only want to modify one field.**

- **With `PATCH`, you can update part of a resource by simply passing in the data of the field to be updated.**

- **C (CREATE)** ðŸ‘‰ `POST` request.
- **R (READ)** ðŸ‘‰ `GET` request.
- **U (UPDATE)** ðŸ‘‰ `PATCH` request. (But if we want to update entire resource then `PUT` request). 
- **D (DELETE)** ðŸ‘‰ `DELETE` request.
