# Redux Notes :-
- Redux is a JS Library predictable and maintainable global state management.
- We can use **Redux Together with React, or with any other view library**. It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies) but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
-----
# React Redux

- **React Redux** is the official **React UI bindings** layer for **redux**. With the help of this **react components** **read data** from the  **Redux store** and **dispatch action** to the store to **update state**.

----- 
# Installation :-

```bash
# NPM
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

# Yarn
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit
```

# How To Use Redux With React :-

### Step :-1 &nbsp; Create a Redux Store :- 
- **Create a folder** which name is **app** inside `app` folder inside `app` folder create a file name which name is `store.js`
- **Path is :-** ðŸ‘‰  `src/app/store.js`
```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

export default configureStore(
    {
        reducer: { }
    }
)
```
- This way we create a **Redux Store.**


### Step :-2 &nbsp; Provide Redux Store to React :-

- **After creating a store** we will have to **wrap** our `<App />` Component to `<Provider>` so that, we can use the state with the help of store.
- Once the store is created , we can make available our react components by putting a React Redux `<Provider>` around our application.
- Path:- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp;**src/main.jsx**

    ```JSX
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
    import App from './App.jsx'
    import store from './app/store.js'
    import {Provider} from 'react-redux'


        ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
        <React.StrictMode>
  
        {/* Here we wrap With Provider  */}

        <Provider store={store} >
        <App />
        <Provider>

        </React.StrictMode>,
        )
    ```
